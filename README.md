# reddit-loading-animations | about

This repository is a collection of fun reddit loading animations I've created
using HTML/CSS with a Sass/SCSS preprocessor.

# reddit-loading-animations | use

Feel free to use these animations for anything at all. Credit not required, but
appreciated. :)

To use these in your own projects/websites, just compile the SCSS to CSS using
whatever method you choose. See http://sass-lang.com/ for more information.
